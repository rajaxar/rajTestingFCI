Historic Home Upgrades & Sculpture Conservation - Upgrades were completed including fresh paint, new pedestals, and the addition of artwork that had previously been in storage. Two art conservation projects were completed to add two new pieces to the sculpture gardens.

Its popularity resulted in a significant increase in museum attendance, overwhelmingly positive visitor feedback, and increased awareness of Central Florida's local heritage.   Goals 2019Facility Upgrades & Progress Towards Accreditation - A formal study through the IMLS Collections Assessment for Preservation Program in 2019 will help the museum progress towards seeking funding for structural facility upgrades and eventual accreditation by the American Alliance of Museums.  Complete Stations of the Cross - The highest conservation priority for the museum is the conservation of Albin Polasek's Stations of the Cross. Completion of all 12 stations by the end of 2019 will ensure this important work of art endures into the future.

Fighting Lung Disease  Every year, the American Lung Association funds scientific research to improve treatments and find cures for Americans with chronic lung diseases.   Fighting Childhood Asthma  Asthma is the leading serious chronic illness among American kids. Our Asthma Clinical Research Centers (ACRC) conduct large clinical trials that provide immediate and useful information for people who have asthma. Through our educational programs like Open Airways for Schools, we give children the tools they need to manage their asthma. In Fiscal Year 2018, over 1,100 people completed Asthma Basics in the Central Florida area.   Fighting Secondhand Smoke  Secondhand smoke is a serious health hazard causing close to 50,000  deaths per year. It can cause or exacerbate a wide range of adverse  health effects, including lung cancer, respiratory infections, and  asthma.   Fighting Smoking  The American Lung Association led the decades-long fight to give the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authority over the marketing, sale and manufacturing of tobacco products to stop tobacco companies from preying on children and deceiving the American public. This legislation was signed into law in June 2009. Most recently, the American Lung Association was one of the leading organizations that changed the policy surrounding the FDA's regulation over e-cigarettes, cigars, and hookah and placing an age minimum (18) in order to purchase.  Fighting Air Pollution  The American Lung Association fights relentlessly for Healthy Air.We work for the cleanup of dirty diesel trucks, buses, heavy equipment locomotives and marine vessels - steps to reduce pollution that leads to asthma attacks and premature death.

In 2018, ASGO hosted 220 activities to support families living with autism in Central Florida, as well as, community businesses and agencies who find the need for more understanding and acceptance of customers and employees.  The program that continues to grow the most is our Autism Awareness Training for LEO's & First Responders.  With more individuals with autism living in the community, the more opportunities for LEO interaction.  Most officers have received little to no training on autism which is why the training that ASGO provides free of charge to LEO agencies is vital.  ASGO fills the training need not only for law enforcement officers, but also firefighters, EMS, and hospital personnel.  This need has also grown to include security officers in many different Central Florida businesses.  In addition to the training needs of community resources, ASGO hosts social skills for individuals with autism between the ages of 2 to 30.  Social skills deficits is one of the characteristics of those with autism, yet not much teaching goes into helping those with autism overcome those deficits.  ASGO's social skills groups give individuals with autism the opportunity to go out in the community in a safe & supportive group to experience our community.  Events include making pizza, preparing swag bags for several events, karaoke, event loading, bowling, etc.    Our awareness events & family outings continue to provide opportunities for our families to go out in the community in a safe & supported environment as a family unit.  So often, families are forced to split up with one parent staying home with the individual with autism and the other parent taking the siblings out.  ASGO believes the family unit needs to stay together and enjoy community outings as one.  Throughout 2019, ASGO will continue to offer awareness training for first responders, hospital staff, and State Attorneys.  In addition, our social skills groups will continue throughout the year to provide much needed training for those with autism.  Our family outings will continue to increase so families will continue to feel supported in the community.  And, our Autism Art Program, where young adults spend several days per week creating art projects that can be sold to earn money for the individual, will be continuing for another year.  It's been a great way for them to express themselves through the creation of art.  We have seen an increase in social skills and spontaneous communication not only with our other artists, but the community as a whole.   And finally, we are continuing our Sibling Support Programs that consist of day events that focus on the needs and supports of our siblings.  We anticipate hosting several of these special days.  In addition, we always hold a special sibling recognition portion of each of our large events.  We want to ensure that the siblings are receiving support for themselves too.

That isn't enough for Beacon and we will not accept it for our students. We empower our students not to \"make do,\" but to make, to do, to dream and to be the most that they can be. Both within the classroom and far beyond it, Beacon faculty and staff nurture a vivacious learning laboratory that calls upon our students to seek and cherish all of life's richness.    Over the past year the college has continued its path of success to excel our students, community outreach, and education in the area of neurodiversity. The following is a short list of our recent accomplishments:  1. Beacon's Anthrozoology program partnered with Lake County Animal Services to bring hands on benefits to the college's \"Animal Shelter Operations & Management\" course. The partnership allows the college to expand offerings related to companion animals, and students can witness theory and research applied in real-life animal shelter operations during once-weekly visits.  2. Beacon College hosted its first Symposium on Learning Disabilities which offered a unique exploration of challenges faced everyday by both students with learning disabilities, their support networks, educators and employers. The symposium focused on proven strategies, real-world experiences, and actionable steps, that assisted attendees with a fresh insight and implementable ideas. The event held at Lake Receptions in Mount Dora was attended by over 200 educators, professionals and parents.  3. In October of 2019, Beacon College celebrated its 30th year as an Institution serving students with Learning Disabilities. The celebrations kicked off with a Gala thanking all of those that have contributed to the success of the college and announced the commencement of our Capital Campaign. The rest of the week included several speakers and performances that were open to parents, students and the many to the public as well.  4. Beacon College moved to the head of the class of its new ranking of the best higher education institutions in the United States for collegians with learning disabilities. Peterson's, a top academic publisher and post-secondary resource, ranked the college No. 1 on its list of \"20 Great Colleges for Students with Learning Disabilities.\" Peterson's ranking focused on schools that \"have implemented programs for students with learning disabilities, optimizing students' potential and providing students with the resources and support they need to thrive in a college academic setting.\"  5. Beacon College capped the 2018/2019 academic year that began with record enrollment by celebrating the school's largest graduating class May 4, 2019 at Lake Receptions in Mount Dora, Fla. during its 30th Commencement. Additionally, Beacon College conferred two honorary doctorates to James T. Brett and Dr. Charles Vert Willie. Brett served as a national disability advocate and former Massachusetts legislator, and served since 1996 as the president and chief executive officer of The New England Council, an alliance of schools, hospitals, corporations. Dr. Willie was the Charles William Eliot Professor of Education, Emeritus at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, Willie's expertise on race helped shape desegregation efforts across the nation.

Campers were encouraged to share personal thoughts and feelings during Cabin Chats or through different mediums (e.g., Arts & Crafts projects, theatre programs). The campers' comments provided a therapeutic outlet not only for the child to honestly express themselves, but also for the volunteers and staff as they learn more about the children in their care and themselves. The campers' and families' responses were extremely honest and, for many, the first time they expressed how they felt about their illness.To ensure that each of the 40+ buildings on the property remain in excellent condition and provide the needed services for our campers, families, volunteers and staff, the Camp's Facility Director manages a 5-year Major Maintenance Plan (MMP).

The goal was to raise $100,000 in one night to fund pediatric cancer research trials. The event was a tremendous success and blew past expectations raising $150,000 for research. The money raised helped fund three trials - for rhabdomyosarcoma and neuroblastoma and allowed another arm to the original immunotherapy brain cancer  trial funded in 2015.

A list of those programs includes: A Gift for Teaching of Osceola County, Bookmark Buddies, Career Pipelines, Charter Schools, Take Stock in Children, and the Foundation Scholarship program.

To put the impact of the Foundation into perspective, currently 86% of the 70,000+ students in the school district are eligible for Free and Reduced Lunch (or population considered at or below poverty level) and those are the same students that benefit from one or more of the programs offered by the Foundation.

FFCFL's outreach events, trainings, warm line support and peer-to-peer support, family monthly meetings and MY LIFE Youth groups have reached over 1,750 families in Central Florida. Our family monthly meetings have increased in attendance by 57%.  MY LIFE is a program for youth by youth. MY LIFE consists of youth between the ages of 13 and 23 who have experience with mental health, substance abuse, juvenile justice and foster care related issues. The program actively engages youth through teaching, coaching and mentoring and empowers them to use their voices to inspire and create positive change for themselves and others in their local communities. We are increasing our trainings and workshops to help educate and inform our families and community providers in Youth WRAP (Wellness Recovery Action Plan), Health & Wellness, CRPS-F (Certified Recovery Peer Support Specialist-Family) and IEP (Individualized Educational Plan) and Youth Mental Health First Aid. The success of FFCFL's outreach events, trainings/workshops and meetings are due to collaboration and long-standing partnerships in the community.  FFCFL is a family-run, family support organization that provides peer-to-peer support. Staff are parents or caregivers of a child/youth (or young adult) with a mental health challenge. It is very difficult for parents/caregivers to maintain employment in the workforce because they need flexibility in caring for their child/youth.  FFCFL's youth leaders are  individuals with lived experience of treatment for a mental,      behavioral or emotional need or personal experience in the foster care      system that occurred before the age of 18 and are comfortable with      using that experience to enhance his/her work within the program. FFCFL provides a supportive workplace environment and therefore, would make a meaning impact in providing employment to families in the community who otherwise would be unemployed or on public assistance.Diversifying funding is a continuous goal to ensure organization meet the needs of families and youth on an individualized level.

Two things limit Freedom Ride's ability to serve more individuals: The number of horses and the weather.     Being a therapy horse is demanding work. It is not only physical but mental so limited the number of sessions daily ensures our horses are always in top form when they in session.   Currently Freedom Ride has 13 horses and would like to add 7 additional to our team. More horses requires more land and the current footprint of 10 acres will not allow for the expansion.  The weather is another critical factor. Freedom Ride does not have a covered arena. This results in canceled classes when it rains, a frequent occurrence in Florida. During the summer, the heat becomes too much for clients and the horses. Services stop from June to August. This gap not only causes clients to lose progress but also hurts the sustainability of the organization that relies on earned revenue for operation.  After 15 years at Trotters Park in Orlando, the lease with the City of Orlando will end on 8/31/2021. Time is of the essence.

The cost to purchase the property, construct a new barn and covered arena as well as refurbish existing structures is estimated at $4.3M. Our plan is to complete the campaign in two phases. The first is a raise of $3M which will cover all construction costs and secure the property and equipment. The second phase will be to pay of the balance of the loan which will be held by the property owner for 10 years.  Freedom Ride has a contract on the property and has begun the permitting process with Orange County. The capital campaign was launched in November and is on target to finish within 12 months.

Ribbit the Exhibit II featured 20 larger than life frog sculptures by J.A. Cobb from December 20, 2018 to January 31, 2019. The summer 2018 'Fairy Doors' exhibit featured 15 one-of-a-kind fairy doors, and led to record-setting attendance. During fiscal year 2018, Leu Gardens welcomed 171,680 visitors. The education department presented 189 classes with 3,594 attendees. In 2017, Guy Darrough's traveling exhibit, \"Dinosaur Invasion,\" featured thirteen life-sized dinosaurs offering a realistic glimpse into the prehistoric world. This exhibit shattered all attendance records for the Gardens and resulted in a 45% increase in attendance over the same period in the previous year.  Educational programming is the heart of our mission.  In 2015-16, 153 classes and educational programs were presented to 2,073 participants.  The 2016 traveling exhibit \"David Roger's Big Bugs\" increased our tours by 59% due to programming which enhanced Florida's Sunshine Standards.  Our future programming plans will continue to increase attendance for the coming years.  Over 100 individuals volunteer on a regular basis at Leu Gardens. The sense of place and camaraderie in our volunteers resulted in volunteered time totaling 5,050 hours for April 2018 - March 2019, valued at $24.69 per hour (State Volunteer Value), resulting in a total donation of $124,684. This number would be doubled if the Leu House Museum was open. We expect our numbers to climb when the historic home reopens.  Goals:  (1) To Maintain and Enhance Plant Collections.  We provide scientific displays of one of the most outstanding collections of indigenous and exotic plants in the Southeast United States.     Leu Gardens receives international recognition for one of the world's largest camellia collections with more than 1,700 of 400 different varieties. Our rose garden is the largest in Florida with more than 1,000 plants in a formal setting. Our team conducts ongoing evaluative research to determine the cold hardiness, heat tolerance, and landscape potential of more than 15,000 plants in our collection.    (2) To Expand Educational Programs.  Our three main areas of programming include adult workshops, student field trips, and tours for outside organizations and groups. Our vast array of workshops includes cooking, gardening, painting, photography, and historical topics for the area to create a learning opportunity for every segment of our community. Our hands-on student field tours and activities enhance plant and environmental science curriculum. We plan to reach at least 65 groups, and more than 2,400 school children. Finally, tours of the gardens and historic home, once open, combined will exceed 20,000 participants.    (3) To Increase Marketing and Outreach.  Our continuing goal is to attract new patrons from the Central Florida region and beyond. Advertising the wide variety of Leu Gardens' programming events is challenging: the diverse subject matter demands niche marketing to attract a wide variety of visitors with unique needs and interests. The exhibition of large sculptures draws thousands of new visitors. Our goal is to feature a new exhibition each year. We project to increase paid memberships by 10% in the coming year. Continued marketing will increase regional awareness of Harry P. Leu Gardens as a tourist destination through increasing regional and statewide marketing initiatives.

After  completing a successful $9M capital campaign which enabled Grace to pay off all  debt associated with building, Grace moved in September 2019. The new facility  allows Grace to serve more patients, recruit more volunteers, and add new  services like dental care.Grace's Dental Center is the largest program expansion since inception. When patients completed a bi-annual survey, 91% reported the need for dental care. This prompted the Board to begin planning to add dental services. A Director of Dental Operations, Michelle Lawton, was hired in January 2019. Michelle created policies and procedures for the program, recruited volunteer dentists and dental hygienists, and opened the Dental Center in October 2019. All dental services are provided by volunteer dentists, dental hygienists, and pre-dental students from the University of Central Florida. Within the first two months of opening, more than 100 patients received dental care.    In 2019, Grace served 1,164 unique patients through 12,913 encounters. Patients visit Grace an average of 11 times every year because of the range of services offered all in one location. At Grace, patients have access to primary care, specialty care, dental care, medication management, nutrition and wellness programs, mental health counseling, and spiritual care.     Grace's goals for the next three to five years will center around how to best utilize the new space to serve more patients. One priority will be to recruit more volunteer primary care providers and nurses. We are currently limited by the number of appointments available to patients because of the number of primary care providers scheduled each week. Additional primary care providers, especially those who are bilingual, will increase the number of patients served. Additional nursing volunteers will help assist the primary care providers and current nursing staff.    Grace is also adding telehealth services in 2020. We hired a Telehealth Receptionist in February 2020 who will schedule and manage telehealth appointments. Adding telehealth appointments will increase the number of appointments available for patients and will assist patients who may not have access to transportation.

Through our ReStores - an upcycled building supply and household goods store - we recycled, restored, and sold 350,000 items in support of affordable housing solutions.  And after the wake of hurricane Irma, we used the yard of our Eustis ReStore as a central hub to disperse more than 100 tons of needed to supplies to families throughout Florida and Puerto Rico, and were an integral partner in Lake County's Emergency Management team.       Lastly, we sent a group of 8 community volunteers oversees to La Ceiba, Honduras to fund the build of two homes in the country and physically assist in building one of those homes for a local low-income family.        Looking to fiscal year 2018-2019:   Over this next fiscal year we are looking forward to creating lasting change in families lives through innovative programs and services, as well as increased partnerships with other local organizations making a difference.    We will begin our Youth Construction Academy, a partnership with The Villages Charter School, where seniors in the construction academy will come out on a Habitat jobsite to build a home from start to finish throughout the school year.  This opportunity will not only provide the students with employable skills in the industry, but it will also allow them to invest in another member of their community. After building the relationship with TVCS, our goal will be to increase the program participation by either growing the student involvement at TVCS or adding an additional school partnership.     We will also launch another training program in partnership with the Lake County Sheriff's Office called the Inmate Construction Academy which will allow construction knowledge and guidance to be offered to select inmates allowing them to gain skills and employment in the construction industry after leaving jail.  These participants will come out to a Habitat jobsite to build one home from start to finish.  Our goal for the start of this program is to graduate 15 inmates through the program and build one home.     And finally, we will begin infrastructure development on our Cottage Community in Tavares, FL, which is a planned unit development  consisting of 23 sustainably built affordable housing units and green space  open to all community members.  The  neighborhood will be designed with apartment sized homes consisting of 680-730sq  ft., rear loading parking areas, and front porches overlooking the community  green space.    The community will  provide access and opportunity to safe, decent, and affordable home ownership  for qualified families.  Our goal for this project is to complete the infrastructure phase by the end of 2019, so that we can prepare to begin the home construction phase in 2020.

The need for adequate and affordable housing is immense, and the lasting impact it can have on families is undeniable. The affordable housing gap in our geographical service area is pervasive.    In the most recent GAP report from the National Low-Income Housing Coalition, Metro Orlando ranked first nationally for its shortage of rentals that are affordable enough for our lowest-income residents. For every 100 available rental units, only 13 are within reach financially.    In an effort to strategically expand the supply of permanent housing solutions for low-income individuals and families, Habitat Seminole-Apopka is leading a unique and tactical collaboration to complete a long-awaited project in Apopka. In 1998, two lots of Section 8 apartments in a south Apopka neighborhood were demolished, leaving 84 families displaced.    Located within our geographic service area, we resolved to acquire the property and begin working toward stabilizing a community overwhelmed by unaffordable and sub-standard rental properties. This new housing development is called Juniper Bend, offering 24 families the opportunity to achieve stability through affordable, permanent housing.     More than 2000 volunteers and subcontractors have been engaged locally to complete this project set to be complete by September 2020. Beyond providing families with a permanent and affordable housing solution, this project will positively contribute to thriving school systems, community organizations and civic activism.

Our goal is to reduce infant mortality and the number of babies born too soon or too small. Healthy Start works by first providing pregnant women a risk-assessment screening for factors that place them at high risk for having a poor birth outcome (premature/low birth weight baby, fetal or infant death). For those who score at-risk, the Healthy Start program then offers them an array of services (e.g., health education, home visits, case management, counseling, etc.) that have been shown to decrease a woman's risk for these poor outcomes. Newborns are also screened at birth and their parents are offered similar services to promote health and developmental outcomes. These services are provided through contracts and collaborations with community providers. In the last ten years, Healthy Start has contributed to a 21% decrease in Orange County's infant mortality rate. In addition, our low birth weight rate has decreased significantly. This represents almost 100 fewer babies born too soon or too small who would have begun their lives in the neonatal intensive care unit. An average stay for a premature or low birth weight baby costs our healthcare system about $50,000; thus, Orange County realized a savings of almost $5 Million dollars because of these healthy births. However, a disparity between Black and White infant mortality rates exists: twice as many Black babies die or are born with low birth weight as White babies. This is a troubling statistic that we are working to reduce. As the lead agency for maternal-child health issues, we work diligently to ensure that our clients' needs are met and that services are not duplicated. We hold inter-agency agreements with both Healthy Families and the Part C program and participate in many agencies' boards of directors and/or committee activities to ensure we have a community safety net for at risk families. These efforts help ensure our service system is integrated and unduplicated.    2017-2018 End of Year Report     Accomplishments:26 years of service to Orange County      1) 16,712 women and infants served2) second graduating class of our Nurse Family Partnership program   3) DOH audit completed without problems  4) Website redesigned   4) Expanded Boot Camp for New Dads   5) grant from PCAN to fund 5 ACA navigators  6) Healthy and Ready to Learn Books distributed with ELCOC funding  7) renewed grant from March of Dimes for prematurity prevention 8)  Partnership with FL Healthcare Coalition for work with self insured companies on healthier pregnancies 9) Had a float in the MLK parade educating about safe sleep practices 10) 99% of infants screened for risk factors11) 7,500 women were helped with prenatal care access thru Medicaid   Goals for 2018-2019Increase visibility in the community of services offered.

Two positions within our management team, the Finance and HR Directors, went from part-time to full-time positions.  We added a Housekeeping Manager, Plant Safety Assistant, and a part-time Grant Writer and Diabetes Nurse Educator. The Diabetes Nurse Educator works directly on educating our residents about managing their diabetes and the importance of diet and nutrition. Individuals with chronic mental illnesses are greatly affected by diabetes due to the medications they take for their illness.  Lakewood upgraded it's IT infrastructure to include a new email system, new software, and an updated website.   Lakewood was selected as one of the top ten finalist in the Victory Cup Initiative; a platform for Central Florida non-profits to tell an audience of 500 philanthropists how their organization changes lives and serves the community.    Goals for the coming year:  One of our main goals is to improve the culture of our organization. By culture we mean, 'the feeling you get when you walk through the door'. We will improve our employee relations, our retention rate and customer service through acknowledgement, respect, and support.  In turn, this will assist us in providing the highest quality of care to our residents and their families.  We will be utilizing TINYpulse, an employee engagement and feedback software program, to help us measure morale and improve performance.  Another goal we have is to add a Diabetes Therapy Group to our PsychoEducation Programs. Group counseling has proven to be very effective in the treatment of diabetes.  Residents receive three meals a day in our Dining Room.  A certified dietician will be revamping our breakfast, lunch and dinner menus with new healthy, organic selections.   Going forward, Lakewood will seek to collaborate with other non-profits on outreach programs that will benefit the Central Florida community. We recently hosted an ALICE training (on countering an active shooter).

We have an 86% success rate defined as sobriety, legal employment, residents obtaining higher education and independent housing. Our theory of change is based on expert experience, lessons learned, best practices, and an independent research which is soon to be published by two different universities on Latisha's House and multiple other safe houses serving human trafficking survivors who are using a trauma informed approach with the Healing Affective Emotional Response to Trauma (HEART) model. Early results state that the trauma-informed approach with a spiritual overlay (HEART Model) showed increased positive results with longer term placement vs short-term. Our 6 year in-house research shows that we have a 12% recidivism rate with our Virginia statistics which we have duplicated the Virginia model in Florida. This is far less than the national average. Our trauma informed framework and theory of change to addressing the problem of human trafficking in Orlando and the Central Florida area is based on a holistic and successful approach for helping the survivor (Elizabeth Hopper 2017).   Latisha's House Florida Accomplishments, Opened February 2019 As Latisha's House Florida was in the planning and development stage in the past year, the collective impact was the action from the community: the Attorney General's Office, MBI, to victim advocates at other agencies, to the civic and faith-based leaders.  (1) Agencies agreed to work together with Latisha's House as part of the theory of change in combatting Human Trafficking and providing safety for female survivors (i.e the 30-90 day Aspire Health Human Trafficking Safe House identified their role as like an 'ICU' for woman coming off the streets who need stabilization and detox from forced and coerced drug addiction and immediate mental health services. Latisha's House would then be the next 'phase' comparable to a hospital's 'Med Surge' unit where women are stable, volunteer, complete education, work towards child custody and complete long term goals towards independent housing. This is the case with other agencies as well from domestic violence and homeless shelters to jails and hospitals, Latisha's House would provide that next piece in the equation of keeping survivors safe over a longer period of time, allowing them to heal and gain sustainable skills and education, breaking the generational cycle of abuse and sexual exploitation one person at a time and for future generations. The ultimate impact is generational. If a woman and her child are taken off the street, the trajectory of the mother's life is changed along with that of her child their children's children. Further, it helps in the collective effort of educating survivors and eradicating the 'supply' of female victims who unfortunately fuel this multi-billion dollar illegal industry. There is also the domino effect of survivors who come into our program and then give back by helping other survivors. (2) The community donated up to $90,000 in materials and services to rehab a beautiful two story house with a pool located in a safe undisclosed community between Maitland and the resort area of Osceola counties. Over 100 people volunteered with labor and time, and over 50 people trained to volunteer once the program started with trauma-informed training. Top Goals for 2019-2020 Year for Latisha's House Florida:  Provide safety and empowerment to least 100 Human Trafficking Victims and their children through long-term, in-house residential program in Orlando or anti-trafficking referral services with partners.

According to the Americans for the Arts Economic Impact Calculator, in 17-18 the A&H and its guests generated more than $3 million in spending. This includes generating $171,898 in state government revenue. This economic activity supports the equivalent of 77 full time jobs. The A&H directly employs 9 FT staff, 10 PT staff, and approximately 20 contract staff.  The A&H is invested in making the State of Florida a cultural destination and vibrant economic center. The A&H's offerings raise the standard of living in the community, increase property values, attract businesses, draw people to the urban area, create civic pride, and strengthen families.   A&H leads youth outreach programming both on and off-site. In 2018-2019 these programs were  refreshed with new themes and activities corresponding to Sunshine State standards.  On an ongoing basis, A&H's professional staff visit schools to lead conversations and hands-on activities for students in art, history, and science.  The A&H leads partnerships with community groups to provide meaningful  experiences for diverse audiences. These partners include the Hope CommUnity Center (a center for families in a traditional migrant worker community), local Girl Scouts, Boy Scouts and Boys & Girls Clubs. Every year more studies demonstrate the importance of humanities education for children to help them achieve success in a wide range of careers. A&H's programs bring this critical education to underserved audiences.   Research demonstrates the importance of lifelong learning for adults and especially for senior citizens who need to be engaged in intellectual and creative activities. A&H also opens its doors to many partners to host their own programming on its two campuses. In August 2014, the A&H opened its newly renovated and expanded Germaine Marvel Building, a versatile exhibition and meeting space that has become an affordable home to many community organizations. Community groups have utilized the space, including Performing Arts of Maitland, Central Florida Community Arts, Scribes of Central Florida, the Antique Tool Show, and Antique Telephone Show.   The A&H museums have a significant impact on its community, region, and state through economic development, art and history education for children and adults, exhibition excellence, artistic development, and historic preservation of some of the state and nation's most important historic sites.

We will continue to build a collaborative community of teachers, students, engineers, artists, programmers, and any other type of makers who can share what they are learning and making with others.  In addition, we have amplified the importance for hands on learning by helping teachers, school districts and workshops harness the maker movement in their classrooms.

For members, the Messiah Choral Society provides one of the few area offerings for focused adult education in organized choral singing.  Our Choral Scholars Program introduces high school students to a unique cultural and service experience. The segments of our audience which benefit most are (1) families with children who cannot afford high priced tickets (2) disabled citizens (3) homeless people and (4) seniors on a fixed income.  The particular value for children, teens and young adults provided such an opportunity is an introduction to exciting classical music and the realization that there are aspects of music that they may not have experienced before.

The staff and volunteers of Mothers' Milk Bank of Florida (MMBFL) work toward the goal of ensuring the availability of safe, pasteurized donor human milk for all of Florida's vulnerable infants. Florida data shows a dramatic decrease in the number of NEC cases as more NICUs develop donor human milk programs. In 2008, before widespread use of human milk, the rate of NEC was 0.23% of all births (500 babies). Two years after MMFBL began dispensing milk to Florida NICUs, 2017 saw most of the regional perinatal intensive care center (RPICC) and several large Level III NICUs using donor human milk. The NEC rate was reduced to 0.17% of all births (387 babies). By 2019, all RPICCs and more than half of Level III facilities use donor human milk. It is anticipated that NEC rates will continue to decline as more NICUs eliminate reliance on formula.     The focus of 2019 has been capacity expansion in terms of physical premises, community partnerships, and human capital. The purpose of these activities was to increase the supply of raw donor human milk, increase production of pasteurized donor human milk, and prepare to accept responsibility to supply all NICUs in Florida.     Milk acquisition efforts have increased our average monthly supply by 35%. Physical expansion has almost doubled the size of our production facility. Most recently, we have added a Community Engagement Coordinator to better serve our diverse constituency.

Granted over $90,000.00 in need-based and merit scholarships to talented students with demonstrated financial need and top competitive talent (choosing to invest a portion of our reserve funds to allow for sufficient scholarship availability for the start-up year of the new baroque program). 4. Met our goal of continuing to transition to paid administrative positions, by again engaging an assistant summer program manager and by contracting with a new Executive and Artistic Director to lead the International Baroque Academy.  Goals for the 2019/2020 Program Season: 1.  Increase support for our organization so that we can rebuild our emergency reserve funds and continue our efforts to progress towards paid administrative staff. When we strategically decided to invest a portion of our reserves to help with the summer 2019 launch of the International Baroque Academy, we did not know that reserves would later be further depleted by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has forced cancellation of our summer 2020 programs and the return of all student tuition payments despite having already incurred many expenses.  2.  Continue to raise funds for the scholarship fund across all areas of our programming, as we work to be in a stable financial position to resume program operations in summer 2021. With so many families being financially impacted by the pandemic, we anticipate legitimate student need for scholarships to be greater than ever when we begin our work in fall 2020 to enroll the MTB and IBA classes of 2021.3.

The Center handles the largest volume of raptors east of the Mississippi River?averaging over 700 patients annually. As an education hub in Central Florida, the Center makes a positive impact in the Maitland/Orlando community connecting people to nature to protect water and wildlife. The Center hosts three focus areas; clinical and rehabilitation, education and outreach initiatives, and research/community science.   Achievements:  1. The past five years have shown high numbers of raptor patients admitted to the Raptor Trauma Clinic; 689 for 2018, 856 for 2017 and 810 for 2016. These patients make it to our doors thanks to law enforcement officers, a small volunteer rescue team, concerned citizens and other rehabilitators. 2.

This study seeks to determine if the type of nest structure a chick hatches in influences its future nest site choice once it has matured. To date the study has banded and released 41 juvenile eagles.   2. Since 1979, the Center has released 620 rehabilitated Bald Eagles back into the wild; a significant conservation achievement.  3. The Center's education initiatives reach 25,000 local students, teachers, and visitors annually, connecting people to nature focusing on birds of prey, the challenges they face and how individuals can impact conservation.   4. Audubon's EagleWatch program engages 420 community scientists to monitor and collect productivity data on Bald Eagle nests in Florida. The program is active in 43 counties monitoring 25% of the state's nesting pairs. This team is protecting Bald Eagles in Florida and the special habitat that supports them.  6. The Center's volunteer network helps support the mission and programs, donating more than 14,000 hours annually.  Goals: (1) Provide quality care and medical treatment to injured and orphaned birds of prey; (2) To conserve and protect Bald Eagles and their habitat; (3) Increase the number and diversity of people taking part in conservation action; (4) Raise additional funds to help the Center become more financially sustainable and build capacity.

Current goals:  *        Increase awareness of nonPareil and student enrollment in Orlando market. Changes in routine can be stressful for people with autism. nonPareil intentionally starts only a few new program participants each quarter. This allows staff time to get to know and understand the new Crew members. It also reduces the stress on existing Crew when faced with meeting and accommodating newcomers. Our space in Orlando can support at least 30 more adults with autism before expansion is needed.  *        Locate additional staff in the Orlando market with a passion and understanding for people with autism and their needs and challenges. As we expand the number of clients we serve, we will also need to increase staff. We want nonPareil to be a friendly, supportive culture for the adults with autism in our program. Caring staff is critical for achieving that goal.  *        Add in our Maitland office the new program, currently being piloted in Houston, to train adults with autism for Google IT certification.

By providing diverse programming with skilled, caring staff we fill in the community gaps and promote a meaningful, developmentally-stimulating experience for the Central Florida special needs population.          Special Olympics: Our very first program has grown from 19 families to 75 participants in year-round training opportunities and has afforded three trips to the National Games for the Mighty Eagles, as our team is fondly labeled.  In summer 2018 we became National Champions with our first team comprised of athletes with special needs only, reaching ultimate success for both these athletes and their families. This program provides participants and families a typical recreational program focused on personal development and physical health.       Recreation Program:  Our second program founded by a need to have supportive child currently supports 52 individuals during afterschool programming and 100 children in the 2018 summer months.  Through the integration of Applied Behavior Analysis techniques and diverse curriculum we can provide both afterschool, day camp, and summer camp programming to individuals that have not been successful is community-based services in the past.  Through participation in these programs, 100% of participants show a global skill development that includes communication skills, independent living skills, social skills, and healthy leisure habits that result in decreased maladaptive behaviors without specific 1:1 therapy service. We provide access to dance therapy, music therapy, art, science, and recreation for children ages 3 to 21.  This allows our families a typical experience for childcare, as well as enables families to have employment outside of school hours.        Adult Vocational Training: This program provides meaningful day activities focused on personal choice, vocational options, and individualized social preferences for 53 adults this year.  OCA developed a vocational program, in contrast to a standard adult day program offered by other agencies, to ensure our service was focused on providing a meaningful day program that supports choice of vocation while continuing to develop life skills and healthy living habits.  The vocational training program has grown from successfully supporting these individuals because of the quality of staff, variety of vocational opportunities, and development of a multiple tracks model to support everyone with their personal goals.       Therapy Department:  The only research supported treatment for autism is Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), but the benefits of ABA extend well past this niche.  OCA provides ABA support to all participants across departments, regardless of funding, by ensuring that 80% of staff members are certified in Professional Crisis Management and Positive behavior supports and supporting program implementation with Board Certified Behavior Analysts.  The therapy department has provided therapy for 250 clients through the one-on-one services, respite services, social skills sessions, or a combination of the three, with over 100 clients in the current year.  Through ongoing monitoring of individualized treatment plans, we can provide consistent adaptable training and ensure clients are provided opportunities to transition to less restrictive care and ultimately to unsupported participation in OCA programs and the community at large.  In the last fiscal year, 45% of the clients serviced in 1:1 setting have successfully transitioned to a lower intensity of service, including transitioning from a clinical intervention program to public school with home supports only.

As the only musical voice  for the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community in Central Florida, the  Orlando Gay began in 1990 when the gay community in Orlando was mostly  closeted.  The founding members decided it  was important to add the word \"gay\" to the organization's title:  Orlando Gay Chorus, People with Pride. Today, our  award winning chorus of over 150 voices represent men and women who are gay,  straight, bisexual and transgender. We have gone beyond diversity and into the  realm of inclusion. It is important for Central Florida to see and understand  the importance of the GLBT community. We are an integral part of the fabric of  Central Florida. Our songs are sometime humorous, sometime serious, but we  always sing with a message of tolerance, compassion and understanding. Our  message is to promote a world free of prejudice.  Our voices win freedom.    In the past 3 years, we have expanded our presence in the community by partnering for a performance with the Orlando Philharmonic and  taking part in community events such as World Aids Day and Orlando Festival of Trees, the Crimeline Chili Cook-off, Paws in the Park, and the Florida Blue Concert Series at the Dr. Phillips Center for Performing Arts.    The Orlando Gay Chorus is in its second year of implementing a 3-year strategic plan. The final result will give the chorus a board of directors will stronger skills to manage the organization's finances and publicity and designate leadership that will manage the day to day operations. The chorus is also transitioning from a community-based chorus to a semi-professional choral organization. These adjustments will allow Orlando Gay Chorus to build capacity to meet the growing needs of the organization.

The majority of our patients are women aged 18-34, many with limited or no health insurance. Many are uninsured, live with limited income, and have experienced trauma. Our patients often juggle multiple jobs or schoolwork, and may have young families, which makes access to reproductive health care challenging. All of these factors make access to safe and supportive family planning and reproductive health care crucial to their ability to reach their goals, protect their health, and build their future--without shame or judgement. Our affiliate mobilized significant numbers of activists of all ages to communicate with elected officials and thought leaders regarding the importance of access to reproductive health care and prevention information.

Participating instructors/directors were exempt from generating a Professional Development Plan and demonstrating progress if they possessed an Associate's degree (with at least 21 Early Childhood/Child Development; Elementary Education or Youth Development credits) or a Bachelor Degree or higher (with at least 42 Early Childhood Education/Child Development; Family and Child Sciences; Elementary Education or Youth Development credits).

The monetary increases in reimbursement and bonuses for success in the program not only give child care providers motivation to improve quality, but the funds to make quality happen giving incredible potential to positively impact the lives of thousands of children in our community.

Through Mission United we have been able  to find children in the foster care system who need legal assistance  and begin assisting them.   Pro Bono Legal Beagle:    Our office, despite our continuous effort, cannot handle every legal  case that comes our way. We are thankful for the dedication of the Pro  Bono attorneys in Seminole County who dedicate their time and resources  to the economically disadvantaged. Because of this we will be making it  easier in the coming year for them to donate their time and knowledge  through our website. This change will make it easier for them to find  clients who could use their area of practice.    Guardianship Advocacy for Disabled Adults & Children:     In the upcoming year we are looking forward to being able to help more  guardians with their legal cases involving guardianship of disabled  adults and children. This is an active need in Seminole County and we  are excited to begin helping these families.  2015-2016 Fiscal Year Accomplishments  Veterans Event:       Once a month SCBALAS partners with the Seminole County Library System to offer free legal services to veterans. Through the combined dedication of staff and pro bono attorneys we are able to offer legal advice on family and housing matters to all veterans without any constraints. Because of our work to serve veterans we were awarded the L. Michael Roffino Award by the Florida Bar Solo and Small Firm Section. Domestic Violence Project:    In 2015, we helped 125 adult victims and 175 child victims of domestic violence gain legal assistance. Through offering legal workshops, legal consultation, and legal representation we have been privleged to see many leave harmful circumstances. Elder Law Month:    During May we were able to offer multiple presentations through the Florida Department of Elder Affairs. We hosted workshops on insurance, wills, and power of attorney in order to better educate those who need this information but have no access to it. Social Media & Website:   We want our resources to be available and easy to access for all who need them. Therefore we have recently completely redone our website along with added multiple social media accounts so that we can better reach our community.

These early childhood providers have come together to share their passions and learn from one another in a community of practice. These providers have found strength in knowing they are all experiencing similar challenges and successes. As a community, they have worked together and strategized solutions to overcome their common challenges. The community of practice model has inspired many providers to continue their professional development journey. As a result, the professionals participating in these learning communities have demonstrated a strong commitment to improving the quality of early childhood education.    The ELC of Seminole has also established a task force for community child care comprised of local employers, child care center owners and parents to develop and implement a plan to attract new employers and employees to the Child Care Executive Partnership (CCEP). The CCEP is a program that utilizes state and federal funds as match incentives for private companies to offer childcare a part of a menu of high-quality benefits.    We have recently launched Champion Families as a new program established in collaboration between The Early Learning Coalition of Seminole and Above and Beyond: Children & Community Services. The goal of this program is to give caregivers of young children, who are employed or pursuing a higher education, increased access to high-quality child care without straining the family's finances. The Coalition in concert with Above and Beyond will continuously seek grant funds in order to further the mission of the Champion Families program.The ELC of Seminole will pursue formalizing a structured and ongoing volunteer program comprised of local high school students and community members.

SafeHouse of Seminole Advocates provide such resources to include: 24-hour crisis hotline; safe, confidential emergency shelter; individual and group advocacy; economic empowerment programs; legal advocacy; child trauma counseling; and short and long-term housing.   *          Emergency shelter: Women who were actively attempting other strategies at the same time, a     stay at a shelter dramatically reduced the likelihood they would be abused again.   *         Community-based advocacy programs for domestic abuse survivors:   Advocates work with       women across a variety of areas: safety, education, employment, housing, legal assistance, issues for children, transportation, and other issues.  Women who work with the Advocates anticipate experiencing less violence over time, higher quality of life and social support, and less difficulty obtaining community resources over time.   o   Close examination of which short-term outcomes led to the desired long-term outcome of safety found that women who had more social support and who reported fewer difficulties obtaining community resources reported higher quality of life and less abuse over time.   In short,  if programs improve survivors' social support and access to resources, these serve as protective factors that enhance their safety over time.   o   While local programs are not in the position to follow women over years to assess their safety, they can measure whether they have increased women's support networks and their knowledge about available community resources.  *          Safety Planning:    Survivors were asked what strategies they had used to stop or prevent the abuser's violence. For every strategy mentioned, women were asked if it made the abuse better, worse, or had no effect. Not surprisingly, for every strategy that made the situation better for one woman, the same strategy made the situation worse for another. However, the two strategies that were most likely to make the situation better were contacting a domestic violence program, and staying at a domestic violence shelter.   o   These answers provide strong support for the importance of domestic violence programs.   o   It is important to note, that women who were experiencing the most violence, and whose assailants had engaged in the most behaviors considered to be indicators of potential lethality, were the most actively engaged in safety planning activities, but remained in serious danger, despite trying everything they could.  o    These findings highlight the importance of remembering that survivors are not responsible for whether or not they are abused again in the future.   o   For some women, despite any safety strategies they employ, the abuser will still choose to be violent.  *          Support groups offer mutual support and understanding, and discussion of dynamics of abuse. Advocates find significant improvements  in women's self-esteem, sense of belonging, focus of control, and overall stress over time.

In cooperation with Hope & Help of Central Florida, Inc. we started a PrEP clinic (medications people can take to protect them from being infected with HIV) to serve the uninsured.  This is a great opportunity to stop HIV transmissions in Central Florida (Central Florida is #1 in new infections in the U.S.) for people who would not normally have access to these medications due to lack of insurance. This program began in February 2016.3.  Following the Pulse Nightclub shooting, we orchestrated the mobilization of over 650 volunteer counselors stationed at The Center, the Zebra Coalition's Crisis Hotline, an emergency counseling center at the First Unitarian Church, Hope & Help, and the memorial on the lawn of the Dr. Phillips Performing Arts Center.  We also sent counselors out to organizations and businesses when requested and staffed counselors at area gay bars/nightclubs. This volunteer emergency response lasted until July 1.  We logged almost 1,000 mental health encounters in the 3 weeks between June 12 and the July 4th Holiday Weekend.4. In April 2017, we received a grant from the U.S. Department of Justice for $979,260 to hire additional staff to support the ongoing Pulse Nightclub Shooting medical and mental health treatment.  While waiting for the grant to become operational, we received a grant from the Better Together Fund  for $91,854 to provide ensure our work can get started and continue. In 2017, we have provided mental health services to 33 people directly affected (either in the club or a loved one of someone who was) and outpatient medical services to 27 people directly affected.  5.  In August 2017, we celebrated our 2-year anniversary.  We have experienced 864% financial growth during our first two years of operations and have expanded a staff of 7 to a staff of 23. 6.  In May 2017, our 340B program went operational, enabling us to provide wholesale pricing on pharmaceuticals to our patients who are without insurance. 7. In October of 2018 we assumed over 12,00 square feet on the 4th f1oor of the building we occupy expanding our service to include an on-site pharmacy, a patient care team, expanded service delivery and support staff and enhance infrastructure.8. In October of 2018 we expanded our staff of 23 to a staff of 44. 9.

Our collaborations ensure victims receive the individualized care they need.  VSC runs the only certified rape crisis centers in Orange, Osceola and Seminole Counties. For two of those counties we operate two separate forensic facilities. From hotline calls to a forensic exam by our trained nurse examiners to long term case management and therapy, we provide victims with a safe space, support, and tools to become a survivor.  VSC not only addresses trauma in the aftermath of crime, but also works to prevent crime. Our education and prevention presentations were developed to meet the needs of five at-risk populations - LGBT, youth, Latino/as, military, and homeless. Last year, our team participated in 403 outreach events to reach at-risk populations as well as the community at large.   VSC is dedicated to meeting best practices in trauma-informed services and is committed to continually evaluating and structuring programming to meet three foundational goals: crime prevention and education by starting with the Central Florida youth, immediate crisis intervention, and a continuum of services through case management and therapy.

The organization was formed when plans arose to demolish the historic 1927 Edgewater Hotel. After an investor stepped forward to restore the important historic structure, the Foundation began making steps to save other endangered buildings in the downtown center, becoming the moving force behind the restoration of the historic district and a strong voice promoting historic preservation. In 2008, after a $3.5 million restoration project, we reopened the historic 1935 Garden Theatre, now a performing arts center bringing over 50,000 people to downtown annually. We have also restored the city's two historic railroad depots, both serving as museums. In January 2015, we opened the History Research and Education Center, providing a local history archive, a Visitors' Center, and a meeting space for rentals.  This meeting space, Heller Hall, is a popular event venue in downtown Winter Garden, bringing new audiences to the Winter Garden Heritage Foundation and historic downtown Winter Garden. The programs and activities impact not only downtown Winter Garden, but the surrounding neighborhood areas as well. Partly because of our work, the city is known today for its charming historic brick buildings that are  occupied by restaurants, retail shops, and small businesses. Once almost deserted, the downtown streets are now teeming with people.  In 2016, we served 97,577 people (roughly 30.4% from outside Orange County and 30% from minority populations) during 124 events. In 2018, we estimate that we will serve 111,125 people at 128 different events. According to the Americans for the Arts economic impact calculator, our proposal programs in 2018/2019 will have an economic impact of $2,500,000.

And we are proud to share some of the wonderful accomplishments from the past several years. Some concrete proof of that came when the state of Florida recently released the 2016 - 2017 Voluntary Pre-Kindergarten (VPK) readiness rates for private VPK providers like us.  These are used to determine whether or not VPK providers are adequately preparing students for kindergarten.  This is the first time since 2013 that these scores have been released. We are so proud that during the 2016 - 2017 school year 82% of our students, who were assessed by their kindergarten teachers, passed the screening! This is a significant increase from the 60% our students who passed in 2013!  In addition to the hard work of the teaching staff, this increase can be attributed to, to our implementation of the Nemours BrightStart! Program.  This program works with small groups of students identified as at risk of reading failure when they get to elementary school.  Another noteworthy development, one way we are striving to take the day nursery to the next level of educational excellence is by converting one of our classrooms to an infant toddler room in response to community need. We successfully opened this room in August 2018 with the support of our donors and friends, thus enabling us to care for four infants and as many as 10 toddlers. By working with children at younger ages than in the past, the day nursery is better equipped to provide early intervention, when needed -- this will set the young children up for success as they grow.  This is just another way we are meeting the expressed needs of our staff and our parents for an affordable, high-quality program to care for their young children and babies.  By offering substantial tuition scholarships, so parents can continue to work and/and or attend school secure in the knowledge their children are being well cared for, we are improving the lives of both low-income parents and their children. With a burgeoning 'wait list' -- and challenged on how to best grow to meet community needs -- Winter Park Day Nursery's board of directors was able to develop an action plan thanks to the generosity of a grant from the Central Florida Foundation. From this WPDN was able to develop a business plan detailing 'next steps' to increase our capacity to serve families. The Foundation funded a professional consultant to lead our team through the planning process in 2017. The business plan results suggested that there are several options for growth that are viable options for the school however, it was suggested that in order for the school to be able to conduct a successful capital campaign for growth, we needed to strengthen our development and fundraising program to increase the base of individual donors to the organization. This concept then became the first goal to be be included in the Nursery's new Strategic Plan for 2017 - 2020.  The three goals in the strategic plan are: 1. To build a development program to strengthen donor relations and grow individual gifts leading to a future capability of a successful capital campaign. 2. To create a plan to increase salaries of qualified staff and decrease employee turnover. 3. To clarify and implement board of directors duties and responsibilities to improve board qualifications training and involvement.   Finally, an important first-step toward our goals that grew out of our board's strategic planning efforts was the $54,000 grant we recently received from Dr. P. Phillips Foundation.  This support is paving the way for Winter Park Day Nursery to implement a more aggressive, and strategic, fundraising and development effort that will increase our capacity to set the agency up for future success.

Our goal for this year is to build on the momentum and strengthen our BOD. We are fostering potential relationships in Tampa and Jacksonville in order to bring our empowerment program to those cities and with an ultimate goal of increasing our reach in cities across the country. Fortunately members of our WOW team either live in those perspective cities or have developed relationships with community leaders who can start the conversation.  We also recognize the need for blended families to have viable resources to help navigate what has become the 'new normal'. According to recent statistics, 1300 new stepfamilies are forming every day and 75% of stepfamilies complain of 'not having access to resources as a stepfamily.' The WOW Blended Family Forum is addressing that need and our goal is to increase the awareness, resources and involvement within the community and among the blended families who need it the most.

In 2018, WUCF premiered its first full length documentary: The Groveland Four, which investigated a racially charged rape case in 1949 that helped lay the foundation of the Civil Rights Movement. The four accused men were finally granted pardons in 2019.  Arts Impact Project Launch: WUCF launched a project to convene local arts organizations to create heightened visibility and financial support for these organizations.  The first output from this project was the production of A Classical Christmas in collaboration with the Bach Festival Choir. This show will be distributed nationwide in 2019.   Goals for the next 12-18 months:   WUCF is replacing our nearly 20-year-old transmitter with a brand new, state of the art ATSC 3.0 transmitter. The new transmitter replaces an older tube-style transmitter with a solid state system that will be more robust and bring the viewer a higher quality picture, as well as delivering data signals to homes.  The project will be completed in January 2020.  To continue to grow financial support, we must broaden our base of donors.  Our goal is to grow annual giving with 20,000 new station members.   We will expand our major donor program to prepare for future capital campaign to invest in new facilities that will allow for enhanced community engagement.
